This is a repository containing the code for an Azure Function app that uses Azure Storage Tables, and Socketlabs to manage an email subscription based on RSS feed updates. 

It's not really designed to work with anything other than my personal website/RSS feed files/etc. so it's brittle, but could be useful to look at if someone else wanted to implement something similar.
